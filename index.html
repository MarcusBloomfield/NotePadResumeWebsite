	<div class="blurb">I began learning how to code C# in Unity in 2018 and launched my first app on the Play Store in 2019. Software development is my passion. The creative and problem-solving mindset that is required by coding is why I love programming and will make a valued addition to any team. I am seeking an opportunity to further spark my professional development. </div>

		<div> In 2019 my first app launched on the Google Play Store.
		I have also been working on smaller side projects which include smaller games and react-based websites as well as my passion project. My passion project is a city-building strategy game with an in-game intelligence system intended to allow for a greater level of realism. Making games is a huge challenge but I welcome it. I am also currently working on an ambitious 3d VR game with a couple of good friends.</div>
